dmenu 5.4 with center 20250407 + xresources 4.9 patches, to be used with ```~/.Xresources``` or a program that sets colorscheme (such as [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) or [pywal16](https://github.com/eylles/pywal16)). nothing special.

for dmenu scripting walkthroughs and ideas, here are the videos I've made about it:
- [you're not using dmenu at full power, yet...](https://youtu.be/4JWeU78A95c)
- [clipboard history via a shell script and dmenu](https://youtu.be/6NeEJVghF_k)
- [Bash scripting into dmenu to improve workflow and solve problems](https://youtu.be/h_E3ddNQ1xw)

to install:
```
git clone https://github.com/BreadOnPenguins/dmenu
cd dmenu
sudo make install
```
