[null-ls] failed to run generator: ....local/share/nvim/lazy/none-ls.nvim/lua/null-ls/loop.lua:165:
"code/fizzbuzz.py" 9L, 183B written5:37 AMDiagnosed null-ls tool installation issue, sought clarificationDiagnosed null-ls tool installation issue, sought clarificationThe user is seeing a null-ls/none-ls error. This is a common issue - null-ls (none-ls) failing to run a generator usually means the underlying tool (like a linter/formatter like pylint, flake8, black, etc.) isn't installed or isn't in PATH.
They probably just want to know what's causing it and how to fix it - but I don't have the full error message. Let me ask or give a general answer.DoneThe error got cut off — missing the actual error message after loop.lua:165:. But the most common cause is the underlying tool (formatter/linter like black, pylint, isort etc.) not being installed or not in $PATH.
Run :NullLsInfo in nvim to see which sources are active and which are failing.null-ls

shwhich black
If not found, install it:
shpip install black --break-system-packages
Or via mason in nvim: :MasonInstall blackits only first time i write a file second time it works5:39 AMKnown race condition with null-ls/none-ls — the formatter process isn't ready on the first save. A common fix is adding a small delay or just ignoring it since it works on the second save.
Or you can configure it to retry by adding on_attach with a slight delay in your none-ls config:
luavim.defer_fn(function()
    vim.lsp.buf.format()
end, 500)
But honestly if it only fails on the very first write after opening nvim and works fine after,
